            <!-- Insert your terms content here -->
            Prices: $10 USD/hour. <br />
            Money transfer platform: PayPal.<br /><br>
Details<br>
You will receive an e-invoice every 30 days via your registered email.  This invoice will assess the cost of anticipated sessions in the upcoming month based on your current schedule. Any canceled lessons may be rescheduled on alternate days. If you prefer not to reschedule, the extra payment will be applied to the next month’s classes. No additional invoices will be issued until you have exhausted payments already made.<br><br>

When to make the payment?<br>
Except for the first invoice, all payments are made monthly in advance. The first invoice will be issued after you have indicated satisfaction with the first lesson with your assigned teacher. <br><br>

Transfer fees<br>
We add a maximum fee of $5.00 USD on the total amount of each invoice, regardless of the amount you send. This charge covers the PayPal usage fees that all parties incur in making and accepting payment. Your invoice will show total hours at $10 USD per hour plus the transfer fee: <br>
15 hours X $10 = $150 + $5 = ( $155 Total )<br>
You may make early payments using one of our approved payment methods, such as PayPal, or you may request an early payment invoice.<br><br>

Late Payments<br>
Payment is due within two days of the date of invoice.  If an invoice is overdue, our team will contact you at least three times before putting classes on hold.<br>
If you fail to pay any amounts within one two days of the date of invoice, Waraqa has the right to apply Late Fees on each payment that is due but not received. For the avoidance of doubt, Late Fees will not be applied until you have received at least three (3) contacts regarding late payment from a Waraqa team member. We may, at our sole discretion, reasonably delay the application of, or waive wholly or partly, any Late Fee. If Late Fees are or may be incurred as a result of Waraqa’s error, please let us know, and we will waive or refund any such fees. We will contact you as soon as we can to let you know you have missed a payment, and to discuss how the payment can be made. <br>
Please do not proceed with your booking if you believe you cannot afford the payments now or will not be able to in the future.  Please contact us to discuss alternative schedules that may meet your needs.<br>
Any payment received will be applied to the oldest outstanding payment e.g. if your second and third payments are outstanding and you make a payment to us, it will be applied to the second repayment in full.  Any money remaining once the second payment has been settled in full will be applied to your third repayment.<br><br>

Class Cancellation/Refunds<br>
It is your responsibility to notify Waraqa if you intend to cancel classes. All requests MUST be sent to the Whatsapp group at least 3 hours before the lesson/s begin. In this case you will be eligible for rescheduling the canceled class. When teachers experience excessive cancellations or late cancellations, the institution is unable to allocate new students for them to compensate for the cancellations. The cancellation policy provides flexibility to our students without compromising teachers’ schedules as follows:<br><br>
Eligibility is determined as follows:<br>
1- If a teacher cancels a lesson, students will not be charged any fees for the canceled class.<br>
2- If a student cancels a lesson 3 hours or more before the lesson start-time, he can reschedule up to 50% of their total registered monthly hours respectively. For example, if a student is registered for 8 hours per month  and cancels 5 hours, the student will receive credit for 4 hrs (50% of the 8) and no credit for the 5th hour as it exceeded the 50% rule.<br>
Unless we are notified by you that a lesson needs to be canceled, our teachers will be ready and well prepared waiting for you on time Insha Allah. Unless you cancel lessons within the terms of this Payment and Cancellation Policy, you will remain liable to us for the full payment of service, in accordance with your Payment Schedule.<br>
If you are unable to make payments due to financial hardship, please contact us to initiate a conversation with one of our representatives. <br>
